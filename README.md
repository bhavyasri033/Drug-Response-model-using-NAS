# Neural Architecture Search for Drug Response Prediction

This project applies Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques to build optimized deep learning models for predicting drug response using genomic data.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Features
- NAS methods: Random Search, Q-Learning, Bayesian Optimization
- Dataset: Pharmacogenomic and gene expression data
- Outcome: 85%+ prediction accuracy; 25% better generalization on unseen data
- Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸ“Š Highlights
- Reduced training time by 30%
- Personalized drug prediction using AI
- R&D Showcase First Prize at BVRIT
